# Discord Fake RPC Generator
Ever wanted to trick your friends into thinking that you have GTA 6 early access?
Yeah, me neither.
But I made this anyways.
Totally not a waste of time.

## How diz work
- Download python (if you haven't already) [here](https://python.org)
- Download this project (not a virus, I pinky promise)
- Execute ```main.py```.
- It will try to automagically install the dependencies. If this doesn't work, you should install those manually using pip (```pip3 install pypresence```).
- If this still doesn't work, panic (or just search how to install python modules on your particular system)
- When it finally works, you will be greeted by a nice and user-friendly GUI menu thingy.
- Choose your desired game, or option 3 if you want to use your own custom discord app (tutorial below)
- Profit! For some reason, spotify and other activity statuses interfere with the program, so be sure to close them. It is also recommended to remove any custom statusses.

## Custom game
- Go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers) and login
- Click new application. For the name, use the name of the game you want the program to imitate.
- Copy or write down the application id, you will need this later.
- Go to ```Rich Presence > Art Assets```.
- Click ```Add Image```, and add your game logo art. Make sure to change the name to something like logo or something you'll remember.
- Now you're done! Just open the program, select option 3: custom. Input you application id and image name.
